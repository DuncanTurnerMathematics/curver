Curver is a program for performing calculations in the curve complex.
Eventually it will implement the Bell--Webb algorithm to determine the Nielsen-Thurston type of a mapping class.

Curver can be run as a Python 2 or Python 3 module.
For even more speed (~25% more) consider running curver with the -O optimise bytecode option.
