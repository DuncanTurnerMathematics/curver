Curver is a program for performing calculations in the curve complex.
It implements the Bell--Webb algorithm [BellWebb16b]_ to determine the Nielsen--Thurston type of a mapping class.
This algorithm runs in polynomial-time but the constants involved currently make the impractical.

	If you are using Python 3, congratulations — you are indeed a person of excellent taste. — *Kenneth Reitz*
